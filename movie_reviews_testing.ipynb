works in the future, Chris Sanders newest venture behind the camera following his well-liked works as overseer on hits Lilo & Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon and The Croods is a wonderful send-off for the brand that gave us many an animated classic, with The Wild Robot a genuine contender against box-office heavyweight Inside Out 2 as the animated film of 2024.\\n\\nAn adaptation of author Peter Brown\\'s hit books of the same name, Robot has already been drawing rave reviews and comparisons to the likes of The Iron Giant and Sanders own Dragon adventure, far from feint praise for a film in this genre that here manages to become an all-round package sure to inspire those youngsters that will flock to the story of lost robot Roz and her budding friendship with street-smart fox Fink and young gosling Brightbill, who she acts as a surrogate mother for but also a film that will resonate with older viewers who are sure to find much to enjoy from such a lovingly crafted film full of heart and soul.\\n\\nUtilising the entirety of its quickfire 100 minute running time, Robot has very few lulls or downtime as Roz\\'s journey of discovery with new friends, as well as what it means to truly care and love outside of her designed confines takes us on a familiar theatrical ride but one that\\'s done with enough uniqueness and sense of its own identity that there\\'s never a worry that Robot is merely ticking boxes along its way to crafting a memorable outing that will have you cheering, laughing and more than likely crying throughout its course.\\n\\nStanding out amongst everything here is Robot\\'s CG animation style that Sanders himself describes as \"a Monet painting in a Miyazaki forest\", a style that creates more than its fair share of visually outstanding segments and when this lovingly crafted vibrancy comes together with thoughtful lead voice performers Lupita Nyong\\'o as the loveable Roz and Pedro Pascal as the initially detestable but eventually likable Fink and enhanced by Kris Bowers exemplary and soaring score, Robot comes together as a complete package in every department.\\n\\nNarratively Robot undoubtedly takes few risks and many key happenings will be overtly predictable for any seasoned viewer but it would take a very jaded and cold cinematic soul to not find joy and comfort from a film so enjoyable as this, a fitting swansong to a wonderous period of DreamWorks products and a further reminder that the animation world is alive and well with many more notable stories yet to tell.\\n\\nFinal Say -\\n\\nOne of the years most

This was one of my most anticipated films of the year ever since I saw the first teaser and then avoided the others to get spoiled. But even so, I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to say this, but this might actually be the best animated feature in DreamWorks history. Seriously, seeing it is believing. This is seriously one of the most visually gorgeous looking animated movies ever made. It\\'s simply stunning from start to finish, full of enchantment and incomparable beauty that fills the screen with color and life. It really is as if it were a Studio Ghibli animation made from Monet\\'s paintings, and there are times when it\\'s even hard to process everything they have to show you. It\\'s certainly the most impactful work of animation I\\'ve seen since the first \"Spider-Verse\" and an evolution of what the studio did with \"The Bad Guys\" and \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\", and if you hesitate, it\\'s even more beautiful than all of them. I can only imagine what a beauty like this must be like on an IMAX screen and maybe even in 3D, and I will definitely go after that experience when it officially releases, but even in a normal XD theater it was a great spectacle that took my breath away at every frame.\\n\\nThe story itself is quite simple in concept and essence, and if there is anything that can lead to some people criticizing the film, it would probably be for that. But I don\\'t see why anybody would do that because it executes everything it wants to do in an exquisite and irresistible way. I think people forget that even narratives as simple as this also require a lot of effort to make it work, and this film makes it seem easy because it doesn\\'t even need to do much and it wins you over right away. It is an extremely moving journey from beginning to end and is full of very beautiful themes and captivating and lovable characters that deserve to be remembered. The pace is calm and knows how to take its time with the necessary patience, the action is measured but is electrifying when it happens, and the emotional moments hit hard but never with forced appeal, but rather because they earn them through everything they\\'ve built triumphantly. The humor and melodrama are balanced just right, although it is much more focused on the dramatic side, but it is one of those that just warms your heart in a very cozy and touching way. And the musical score is simply fantastic, really what an inspired work by composer Kris Bowers, there were times when it even gave me goosebumps when it played in the big parts of the film. And the voice cast is a delight, Lupita Nyong\\'o is wonderful as Roz and her voice performance is inspired and dedicated, as are Pedro Pascal and Kit Connor who inject a lot of charisma into their characters Fink and Brightbill, and the rest of the supporting cast is full of big names who are also strongly dedicated to the material.\\n\\nThis is the best example of what a great family film should be, one that delights all audiences in different but equally satisfying ways, that does the hard work of captivating its audience through its genuine effort and in such an efficient way that it is hard to know how they managed it. And quite honestly, I cried a lot during several parts because it got me so emotional, and sometimes not because something sad was happening but just because of the magic of being with those adorable characters. I have nothing else to say, just go and see it on the biggest screen possible and dive into this beautiful experience with an open heart, because I seriously doubt you won\\'t like it. I\\'ll say right away that I fell madly in love with this movie and it is now a strong candidate for my favorite film of the year, and maybe even possibly my favorite animated film of this decade so far. Of course, I say this only as my personal opinion and I don\\'t want you to see it having these expectations in your head, I\\'m just being honest and telling you my experience with it and how much it captivated me. I would really like you to see it because I found this to be a special project, and movies like this deserve all the success in the world. If there are still stupid people who can\\'t admire the art and inspiring work of everyone who works in animation, films like \"The Wild Robot\" are examples that put an end to any silly preconceptions that exist in this medium where imagination explodes free. Consider the race for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature done and if it doesn\\'t win it\\'ll be an ugly injustice, and who knows, maybe it will also get a nomination for the score if it can. I\\'m definitely gonna go see this several times in theaters, because this right here is pure magic, heart and enchantment, and if that isn\\'t worth going to the cinema, I don\\'t know what is.', 'reviewTitle': 'An Instant Animated Classic.', 'spoiler': False, 'submissionDate': '2024-09-13', 'titleId': '/title/tt29623480/'}, {'author': {'displayName': 'kaleighpanda', 'userId': '/user/ur189260955/'}, 'authorRating': 10, 'helpfulnessScore': 0.7837939076629495, 'id': '/title/tt29623480/userreviews/rw10044062', 'interestingVotes': {'down': 22, 'up': 125}, 'languageCode': 'eng', 'reviewText': \"When I watched this movie I was not familiar with the book, so i was going in blind, and boy I was not disappointed.

After directing an adaptation of Jack London's classic The Call of the Wild, Sanders adapted an number 1 bestselling novel by Peter Brown called The Wild Robot, it's a heartwarming emotional tearjerking science fiction drama about a robot named Roz, who is stranded in a uninhabited island, and must learn to adapt the surroundings and have responsibility of adopting a young orphaned gosling named Brightbill.\\n\\nSanders, who wrote and directed the film made the film a masterpiece, with his longtime collaborating partner and executive producer Dean DeBois, and producer Jeff Hermann, Sanders had joined forces with Dreamworks Animation, the studio that made Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken, to create this groundbreaking animated masterpiece.\\n\\nWith Oscar Winner Lupita Nyongo in the lead as Roz, along with an all star voice cast, groundbreaking animation, and a heartwarming story that brings the literary phenomenon to life.\\n\\nThe visual storytelling were influenced by films like James Cameron's Avatar films, Brad Bird's Iron Giant, Zemiecks's Cast Away and Kirk DeMicco & Faryn Pearl's Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken while the emotionally character driven acting were also influenced by films like Nick Cassavetes's My Sister's Keeper, Tony Goldwyn's The Last Kiss, Nigel Cole's A Lot Like Love, and R. J. Cutler's If I Stay. Sanders, and the film's Head of Story Heidi Jo Gilbert had crafted a beautiful and heartwarming script and story that developed the emotional relationship between Roz & Brightbill, and setting a even more serious tone that no animated movie had ever gone before.\\n\\nThe voice cast were amazingly well picked, with Lupita as Roz, along with newcomer and British sensation Kit Connor as Brightbill, Pedro Pascal as Flick, voice-acting legend Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, Catherine O'Hara as Pinktail, UK sensation Matt Berry as Paddler, Bill Nighy as Longneck, Stephanie Hsu as Vontra, and Ving Rhames as Thunderbird The Falcon (a brand new character created for the film), they give their best performance that could give this film an potential Oscar frontrunner for best animated feature.\\n\\nSanders had assembled a team of animators, artists, and VFX designers to create a revolutionary and groundbreaking style that was influenced by some of the recent innovations in feature animation with stylized 2d/3d hybrid looks to bring Roz and the world of The Wild Robot to life.\\n\\nThe music and songs were beautiful written and performed, with Academy Award winner Kris Bowers chosen to write the score and songs alongside pop star and singer-songwriter Maren Morris performing 2 original songs written for the film, which includes the indie-folk ballad Kiss The Sky, which is very important to the film.\\n\\nThe film's core message of tech, climate, survival and tearjerking emotional drama made this film a true winner out of all of the other animated films released this year.\\n\\nIt's one of the best animated films of the year, an unforgettable landmark in feature animation since last year's Ruby Gillman.\\n\\nIt's a winner.\", 'reviewTitle': 'Chris Sanders strucks gold once again with an instant classic from a literary phenomenon that is Ruby Gillman & Cast Away meets Avatar & Iron Giant.

The folk at DreamWorks (and sometimes Disney) certainly seem to remember. We know you can use computers to make photoreal lions recite The Lion King; we also know you can mix photorealism with stylization and surrealism if you actually try (and if the film is called Rango). We get how good people are at making things look \"real\".\\n\\nBut now\\'s the time to let our imaginations soar again. Hence, highly stylized 3D productions like Arcane, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Turning Red, the Spider-Verse pictures, and now Chris Wedge\\'s The Wild Robot, productions that look so good and sometimes emulate 2D styles in such a unique way that even someone like my VFX-software-programming dad, whose job is to \"know how this works\", barely fathoms how it works. In the case of The Wild Robot, we get an imaginatively presented story about animals and machines that, oddly enough, is ultimately as human as it gets.\\n\\nThe film is based on a Peter Brown novel about a service robot (here voiced by Lupita Nyong\\'o) washed ashore on a remote island, where it uses its intricate programming to effectively \"translate\" the noises of the various animals and so is able to speak to them (luckily the animals don\\'t seem to have any language barriers among themselves), although the creatures largely regard it as a monster. Its... Her only friend becomes a mischievous fox named Fink (Pedro Pascal), who also helps her in raising a small gosling, the only surviving egg in a nest that she accidentally destroys by the start of the movie; feeding and raising the bird becomes her primary objective. Fink initially meant to have the gosling for dinner, but the robot makes him see things differently.\\n\\nThe gosling, named Brightbill because that\\'s what the robot deems an apt designation for such a lifeform, grows into an ostracized youngster shunned by other geese for being the child of a monster and being unable to fly (on top of using the same sort of \"robot speak\" as his adoptive mother, e.g complaining that bullies beating him up \"induces a pain response\"). Soon enough, he begins to question his true place in this world.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t stuff we haven\\'t seen in animated films before. Characters like Belle, Hercules, and Flik the ant will inevitably come to mind at various points during Brightbill\\'s journey. But the fact that certain beats seem familiar to you and me doesn\\'t really matter much when this is a film for young kids -- who may not have seen this sort of fish-out-of-water story in any shape before -- albeit one that will undoubtedly move parents just as much, if not more.\\n\\nBesides, the movie overall feels fresh and original, although it is technically based on pre-existing material. While it has influences, it mixes them into its own distinct world and atmosphere. (Even the plot as such takes several unexpected turns once it starts to feel \"familiar.\") Wedge has stated that he wanted to make a Monet painting set in one of Miyazaki\\'s forests and certain shots of \"technology at peace with nature\" recall the works of Swedish retrofuturism master Simon Stålenhag.\\n\\nAmong his inspirations, Wedge has also cited Disney\\'s Bambi and Bird\\'s The Iron Giant, both of which this movie lives up to. Additionally, the name of the main character\\'s product line -- a ROZZUM unit by Universal Dynamics, though she prefers \"Roz\" -- is derived from Rossum\\'s Universal Robots, the 1920 Czech play that originated the term \"robot\". (The original title is Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti, \"roboti\" being a play on the Czech word for \"forced labor under serfs\"; when the play was translated to English, the mechanical slaves of the title became known as \"robots\".) Details like that are a testament to the thoughtfulness of this deceptively simple-looking film.\\n\\nI mentioned before that parents will appreciate this film at a different level than kids, which should come as no surprise considering Wedge\\'s track record with Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, which achieved more -- something deeper -- than simply being sci-fi and Fantasy adventures, respectively.

Programmed to complete a task, she has to learn to understand and interact with the animals there and she struggles with connecting and acceptance.

Every new and confusing experience shifts Roz's programming as she experiences things she was never programmed to imagine and finds a new way to live.\\n\\nI enjoyed the humor of this film from DreamWorks Animation. The writing is great. The absurd, yet accurately dark humor, parental comments from Pinktail, a mother opossum, (Catherine O'Hara) are so relatable. Her shocking statements make her character so enjoyable. The animators illustrate the emotional reactions of island animals to perfection. Roz's help initially causes more chaos than assistance. When Roz sees a beaver building a damn, rather than help build it, her programming tells her it's an obstacle and she destroys it. The beaver's response is priceless. The confusion and disbelief when Roz provides a sticker communicating that the task is complete is hysterical. These moments contribute to the humor and build on the character development of The Wild Robot as we watch her struggle to connect with the animals on the island. Her adventures with Fink and Brightbill create bonding moments and we see how belonging, acceptance and connection can be influenced by kindness.\\n\\nThe Wild Robot provides an uplifting message of how belonging and acceptance come from one's heart. It successfully shows how kindness and caring are valued by all. Parents and viewers should be aware there are flashing and strobe lighting effects, loud noises and dark humor, which may be unsuitable for some viewers.\\n\\nI give The Wild Robot 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults.

For years, Pixar films were all about heart and originality, but over the last 14 years, I feel most of their movies, except for Inside Out (2015), have become more generic and superficial. Thankfully, The Wild Robot, even though from a different studio, brought me that same nostalgic feeling I get from watching Pixar's older films.\\n\\nThe story of The Wild Robot is simple yet beautiful and moving. It explores the contrast between technology and nature in a way that's both touching and thought-provoking. From the beginning, we're drawn in by the innocence of the main robot and the curiosity of the animals around it, showing us a unique example of how the natural and artificial can coexist. This contrast is handled with great care, and for most of the movie, I felt fully immersed in the beauty of this interaction.\\n\\nThe characters, each with their own distinct personalities, are instantly captivating.

It's a film that can truly appeal to both kids and adults.\\n\\nHowever, while the first two acts are genuinely emotional and avoid clichés by leaving out forced villains or action scenes, the final act takes a more conventional turn, which is a bit disappointing. It seems to lose some of its original essence and the potential for a unique message, and the ending feels unnecessarily bittersweet, almost as if the producers were already considering a sequel. This final act could have been better developed or even left out entirely to preserve the story's integrity. Personally, I think it would have worked just fine without a traditional villain, focusing instead on a pure journey of discovery.\\n\\nDespite this change in the ending, The Wild Robot is a fantastic title, a breath of fresh air for the genre, and so far, the best animation this year.

       "  'reviewText': 'Marking the end of an extremely successful and entertaining era for DreamWorks in-house animation studios which will move onto outsourced works in the future, Chris Sanders newest venture behind the camera following his well-liked works as overseer on hits Lilo & Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon and The Croods is a wonderful send-off for the brand that gave us many an animated classic, with The Wild Robot a genuine contender against box-office heavyweight Inside Out 2 as the animated film of 2024.\\n\\nAn adaptation of author Peter Brown\\'s hit books of the same name, Robot has already been drawing rave reviews and comparisons to the likes of The Iron Giant and Sanders own Dragon adventure, far from feint praise for a film in this genre that here manages to become an all-round package sure to inspire those youngsters that will flock to the story of lost robot Roz and her budding friendship with street-smart fox Fink and young gosling Brightbill, who she acts as a surrogate mother for but also a film that will resonate with older viewers who are sure to find much to enjoy from such a lovingly crafted film full of heart and soul.\\n\\nUtilising the entirety of its quickfire 100 minute running time, Robot has very few lulls or downtime as Roz\\'s journey of discovery with new friends, as well as what it means to truly care and love outside of her designed confines takes us on a familiar theatrical ride but one that\\'s done with enough uniqueness and sense of its own identity that there\\'s never a worry that Robot is merely ticking boxes along its way to crafting a memorable outing that will have you cheering, laughing and more than likely crying throughout its course.\\n\\nStanding out amongst everything here is Robot\\'s CG animation style that Sanders himself describes as \"a Monet painting in a Miyazaki forest\", a style that creates more than its fair share of visually outstanding segments and when this lovingly crafted vibrancy comes together with thoughtful lead voice performers Lupita Nyong\\'o as the loveable Roz and Pedro Pascal as the initially detestable but eventually likable Fink and enhanced by Kris Bowers exemplary and soaring score, Robot comes together as a complete package in every department.\\n\\nNarratively Robot undoubtedly takes few risks and many key happenings will be overtly predictable for any seasoned viewer but it would take a very jaded and cold cinematic soul to not find joy and comfort from a film so enjoyable as this, a fitting swansong to a wonderous period of DreamWorks products and a further reminder that the animation world is alive and well with many more notable stories yet to tell.\\n\\nFinal Say -\\n\\nOne of the years most pleasant surprises regardless of genre or design, The Wild Robot is a winning mix of heart, humour and imagination, gifting this familiar feeling tale with a sense of wonderment and adventure that should ensure its place amongst the years biggest audience hits.\\n\\n4 feigned deaths out of 5\\n\\nJordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Look, my expectations were already pretty high. This was one of my most anticipated films of the year ever since I saw the first teaser and then avoided the others to get spoiled. But even so, I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to say this, but this might actually be the best animated feature in DreamWorks history. Seriously, seeing it is believing. This is seriously one of the most visually gorgeous looking animated movies ever made. It\\'s simply stunning from start to finish, full of enchantment and incomparable beauty that fills the screen with color and life. It really is as if it were a Studio Ghibli animation made from Monet\\'s paintings, and there are times when it\\'s even hard to process everything they have to show you. It\\'s certainly the most impactful work of animation I\\'ve seen since the first \"Spider-Verse\" and an evolution of what the studio did with \"The Bad Guys\" and \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\", and if you hesitate, it\\'s even more beautiful than all of them. I can only imagine what a beauty like this must be like on an IMAX screen and maybe even in 3D, and I will definitely go after that experience when it officially releases, but even in a normal XD theater it was a great spectacle that took my breath away at every frame.\\n\\nThe story itself is quite simple in concept and essence, and if there is anything that can lead to some people criticizing the film, it would probably be for that. But I don\\'t see why anybody would do that because it executes everything it wants to do in an exquisite and irresistible way. I think people forget that even narratives as simple as this also require a lot of effort to make it work, and this film makes it seem easy because it doesn\\'t even need to do much and it wins you over right away. It is an extremely moving journey from beginning to end and is full of very beautiful themes and captivating and lovable characters that deserve to be remembered. The pace is calm and knows how to take its time with the necessary patience, the action is measured but is electrifying when it happens, and the emotional moments hit hard but never with forced appeal, but rather because they earn them through everything they\\'ve built triumphantly. The humor and melodrama are balanced just right, although it is much more focused on the dramatic side, but it is one of those that just warms your heart in a very cozy and touching way. And the musical score is simply fantastic, really what an inspired work by composer Kris Bowers, there were times when it even gave me goosebumps when it played in the big parts of the film. And the voice cast is a delight, Lupita Nyong\\'o is wonderful as Roz and her voice performance is inspired and dedicated, as are Pedro Pascal and Kit Connor who inject a lot of charisma into their characters Fink and Brightbill, and the rest of the supporting cast is full of big names who are also strongly dedicated to the material.\\n\\nThis is the best example of what a great family film should be, one that delights all audiences in different but equally satisfying ways, that does the hard work of captivating its audience through its genuine effort and in such an efficient way that it is hard to know how they managed it. And quite honestly, I cried a lot during several parts because it got me so emotional, and sometimes not because something sad was happening but just because of the magic of being with those adorable characters. I have nothing else to say, just go and see it on the biggest screen possible and dive into this beautiful experience with an open heart, because I seriously doubt you won\\'t like it. I\\'ll say right away that I fell madly in love with this movie and it is now a strong candidate for my favorite film of the year, and maybe even possibly my favorite animated film of this decade so far. Of course, I say this only as my personal opinion and I don\\'t want you to see it having these expectations in your head, I\\'m just being honest and telling you my experience with it and how much it captivated me. I would really like you to see it because I found this to be a special project, and movies like this deserve all the success in the world. If there are still stupid people who can\\'t admire the art and inspiring work of everyone who works in animation, films like \"The Wild Robot\" are examples that put an end to any silly preconceptions that exist in this medium where imagination explodes free. Consider the race for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature done and if it doesn\\'t win it\\'ll be an ugly injustice, and who knows, maybe it will also get a nomination for the score if it can. I\\'m definitely gonna go see this several times in theaters, because this right here is pure magic, heart and enchantment, and if that isn\\'t worth going to the cinema, I don\\'t know what is.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Legendary Oscar nominated filmmaker Chris Sanders had triumphant in creating an instant classic in feature animation once again. After directing an adaptation of Jack London's classic The Call of the Wild, Sanders adapted an number 1 bestselling novel by Peter Brown called The Wild Robot, it's a heartwarming emotional tearjerking science fiction drama about a robot named Roz, who is stranded in a uninhabited island, and must learn to adapt the surroundings and have responsibility of adopting a young orphaned gosling named Brightbill.\\n\\nSanders, who wrote and directed the film made the film a masterpiece, with his longtime collaborating partner and executive producer Dean DeBois, and producer Jeff Hermann, Sanders had joined forces with Dreamworks Animation, the studio that made Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken, to create this groundbreaking animated masterpiece.\\n\\nWith Oscar Winner Lupita Nyongo in the lead as Roz, along with an all star voice cast, groundbreaking animation, and a heartwarming story that brings the literary phenomenon to life.\\n\\nThe visual storytelling were influenced by films like James Cameron's Avatar films, Brad Bird's Iron Giant, Zemiecks's Cast Away and Kirk DeMicco & Faryn Pearl's Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken while the emotionally character driven acting were also influenced by films like Nick Cassavetes's My Sister's Keeper, Tony Goldwyn's The Last Kiss, Nigel Cole's A Lot Like Love, and R. J. Cutler's If I Stay. Sanders, and the film's Head of Story Heidi Jo Gilbert had crafted a beautiful and heartwarming script and story that developed the emotional relationship between Roz & Brightbill, and setting a even more serious tone that no animated movie had ever gone before.\\n\\nThe voice cast were amazingly well picked, with Lupita as Roz, along with newcomer and British sensation Kit Connor as Brightbill, Pedro Pascal as Flick, voice-acting legend Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, Catherine O'Hara as Pinktail, UK sensation Matt Berry as Paddler, Bill Nighy as Longneck, Stephanie Hsu as Vontra, and Ving Rhames as Thunderbird The Falcon (a brand new character created for the film), they give their best performance that could give this film an potential Oscar frontrunner for best animated feature.\\n\\nSanders had assembled a team of animators, artists, and VFX designers to create a revolutionary and groundbreaking style that was influenced by some of the recent innovations in feature animation with stylized 2d/3d hybrid looks to bring Roz and the world of The Wild Robot to life.\\n\\nThe music and songs were beautiful written and performed, with Academy Award winner Kris Bowers chosen to write the score and songs alongside pop star and singer-songwriter Maren Morris performing 2 original songs written for the film, which includes the indie-folk ballad Kiss The Sky, which is very important to the film.\\n\\nThe film's core message of tech, climate, survival and tearjerking emotional drama made this film a true winner out of all of the other animated films released this year.\\n\\nIt's one of the best animated films of the year, an unforgettable landmark in feature animation since last year's Ruby Gillman.\\n\\nIt's a winner.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Remember when animation was meant to achieve things that weren\\'t possible in live-action pictures or on the stage? The folk at DreamWorks (and sometimes Disney) certainly seem to remember. We know you can use computers to make photoreal lions recite The Lion King; we also know you can mix photorealism with stylization and surrealism if you actually try (and if the film is called Rango). We get how good people are at making things look \"real\".\\n\\nBut now\\'s the time to let our imaginations soar again. Hence, highly stylized 3D productions like Arcane, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Turning Red, the Spider-Verse pictures, and now Chris Wedge\\'s The Wild Robot, productions that look so good and sometimes emulate 2D styles in such a unique way that even someone like my VFX-software-programming dad, whose job is to \"know how this works\", barely fathoms how it works. In the case of The Wild Robot, we get an imaginatively presented story about animals and machines that, oddly enough, is ultimately as human as it gets.\\n\\nThe film is based on a Peter Brown novel about a service robot (here voiced by Lupita Nyong\\'o) washed ashore on a remote island, where it uses its intricate programming to effectively \"translate\" the noises of the various animals and so is able to speak to them (luckily the animals don\\'t seem to have any language barriers among themselves), although the creatures largely regard it as a monster. Its... Her only friend becomes a mischievous fox named Fink (Pedro Pascal), who also helps her in raising a small gosling, the only surviving egg in a nest that she accidentally destroys by the start of the movie; feeding and raising the bird becomes her primary objective. Fink initially meant to have the gosling for dinner, but the robot makes him see things differently.\\n\\nThe gosling, named Brightbill because that\\'s what the robot deems an apt designation for such a lifeform, grows into an ostracized youngster shunned by other geese for being the child of a monster and being unable to fly (on top of using the same sort of \"robot speak\" as his adoptive mother, e.g complaining that bullies beating him up \"induces a pain response\"). Soon enough, he begins to question his true place in this world.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t stuff we haven\\'t seen in animated films before. Characters like Belle, Hercules, and Flik the ant will inevitably come to mind at various points during Brightbill\\'s journey. But the fact that certain beats seem familiar to you and me doesn\\'t really matter much when this is a film for young kids -- who may not have seen this sort of fish-out-of-water story in any shape before -- albeit one that will undoubtedly move parents just as much, if not more.\\n\\nBesides, the movie overall feels fresh and original, although it is technically based on pre-existing material. While it has influences, it mixes them into its own distinct world and atmosphere. (Even the plot as such takes several unexpected turns once it starts to feel \"familiar.\") Wedge has stated that he wanted to make a Monet painting set in one of Miyazaki\\'s forests and certain shots of \"technology at peace with nature\" recall the works of Swedish retrofuturism master Simon Stålenhag.\\n\\nAmong his inspirations, Wedge has also cited Disney\\'s Bambi and Bird\\'s The Iron Giant, both of which this movie lives up to. Additionally, the name of the main character\\'s product line -- a ROZZUM unit by Universal Dynamics, though she prefers \"Roz\" -- is derived from Rossum\\'s Universal Robots, the 1920 Czech play that originated the term \"robot\". (The original title is Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti, \"roboti\" being a play on the Czech word for \"forced labor under serfs\"; when the play was translated to English, the mechanical slaves of the title became known as \"robots\".) Details like that are a testament to the thoughtfulness of this deceptively simple-looking film.\\n\\nI mentioned before that parents will appreciate this film at a different level than kids, which should come as no surprise considering Wedge\\'s track record with Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, which achieved more -- something deeper -- than simply being sci-fi and Fantasy adventures, respectively. Kids and adults always view art differently, of course, but here, that is precisely the point.\\n\\nI even fancied the voice work, although we\\'re once again getting celebrities over proper \"voice actors\". Nyong\\'o, Pascal, Matt Berry, Bill Nighy, Stephanie Hsu, Mark Hamill, and Kit Connor all nail their characters; we never simply hear actors standing near a mic. And I gotta say, this might be the best use of literal nepo babies I\\'ve ever seen/heard -- some of these lines are made funnier by the fact that they\\'re clearly being read by some random child who has never set foot in a recording booth before.\\n\\nGranted, I will admit that there are a few jokes that fall flat and a number of story elements that don\\'t achieve their full potential. (Brightbill eventually learns of the accident that killed what would have been his real family but it doesn\\'t seem to affect the sequence of events all that much.) While I adored the film, the claims that this is DreamWorks\\' best movie, if not the greatest animated feature of all time, strike me as just a touch hyperbolic. But it\\'s nice to learn that DreamWorks was apparently just kidding with Kung Fu Panda 4, Megamind 2, and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"It is genuinely baffling when you come out of a movie like this, having read all of the reviews beforehand calling it one of the great animated movies of all time and this generations Bambi; and wondering to yourself if you'd even watched the same movie.\\n\\nThe animation was great, yes. Although for me personally, the animals became too overly personified and lost some of their charm once they started speaking. But there were some visually stunning scenes, particularly towards the end.\\n\\nWhere the movie was really let down for me was the script writing and the story, which felt clunky and often forced. The writer knew where he wanted to take us and what messages he wanted to convey and he was going to squish the characters and the ensuing narrative into whatever shape they needed to be in order to get there.\\n\\nIt felt overly feel good (all the animals are going to live together in harmony forever after, really? And what are the predators going to eat?), while also being occasionally injected with odd moments of brutality - like a possum mother's child being eaten - which were treated in a weirdly humorous and offhand manner that didn't fit with the film.\\n\\nMaybe i was just feeling overly cynical while watching The Wild Robot, or I'm too accustomed to the subtlety of Ghibli movies that the various messages that were crammed into this film felt like being hit repeatedly over the head with a soft and squishy hammer.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The Wild Robot is a monumental film that in many ways transcends the medium of film into something greater - a portrait of universal human experiences.\\n\\nThroughout the film, a beautiful tapestry of human experience is woven - comprising the experiences of love, nature, connection and belonging. Almost every frame, through the music, through the colours, through the narrative and the composition and the environments, are able to communicate, in their own way, the essence of one of those experiences; and when they are put together they create something far greater than the some of their parts.\\n\\nNow this film, is not a masterpiece, but in my opinion no film or piece of art can be. In many ways it just serves as an excellently made 'kid's movie', with nice universal themes and Schadenfreude humour. But what's great about this film is that it's visceral; it's direct. And that is in opposition to many films that are just targeting an adult audience.\\n\\nA common mindset shared between many artists is that oblique complexity lends itself to high value art. That vague themes and narratives ushers the art into the club of 'high art.'\\n\\nBut in part due to the fact The Wild Robot is a 'kid's movie', it avoids those pitfalls of obliqueness and is able to beautifully and directly convey its themes.\\n\\nAnd although The Wild Robot is a film, it has the essence of a tapestry, of a painting. In so many of the frames, there is a profound sentiment expressed. The frames pique a ruminative state, while also engrossing your emotions. It's truly something special to experience. And an experience I have not had before in the over 300 films I have seen.\\n\\nIn terms of film-making techniques, originality and creativity, there are certainly other films that could be said as being superior. But in terms of visceral expressions of love, of human experiences and the ups-and-downs of connection - The Wild Robot is in a category of its own as a film. And I think it belongs with some of the best art humanity has ever created.\",\n",

This animated film is heartwarming and laugh-out-loud fun.\\n\\nWhen a shipping container is lost at sea during a typhoon, Roz the Robot (Lupita Nyong'o), emerges as the sole survivor on an island with nothing but wildlife. Programmed to complete a task, she has to learn to understand and interact with the animals there and she struggles with connecting and acceptance. Her journey takes a turn when she assists an orphaned goose, Brightbill, (Kit Connor) and gets help from a fox named Fink (Pedro Pascal). Every new and confusing experience shifts Roz's programming as she experiences things she was never programmed to imagine and finds a new way to live.\\n\\nI enjoyed the humor of this film from DreamWorks Animation. The writing is great. The absurd, yet accurately dark humor, parental comments from Pinktail, a mother opossum, (Catherine O'Hara) are so relatable. Her shocking statements make her character so enjoyable. The animators illustrate the emotional reactions of island animals to perfection. Roz's help initially causes more chaos than assistance. When Roz sees a beaver building a damn, rather than help build it, her programming tells her it's an obstacle and she destroys it. The beaver's response is priceless. The confusion and disbelief when Roz provides a sticker communicating that the task is complete is hysterical. These moments contribute to the humor and build on the character development of The Wild Robot as we watch her struggle to connect with the animals on the island. Her adventures with Fink and Brightbill create bonding moments and we see how belonging, acceptance and connection can be influenced by kindness.\\n\\nThe Wild Robot provides an uplifting message of how belonging and acceptance come from one's heart. It successfully shows how kindness and caring are valued by all. Parents and viewers should be aware there are flashing and strobe lighting effects, loud noises and dark humor, which may be unsuitable for some viewers.\\n\\nI give The Wild Robot 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults. The Wild Robot releases in theatres on September 27,, 2024. By Emma O., KIDS FIRST!\",\n",

The script, however, is a little clunky and a little too cheesy and I don\\'t think the script ever makes is really care about the robot and the baby mallard\\'s relationship (as much as it does the robot and the fox) so it wasn\\'t really an emotionally satisfying journey.\\n\\nAlso, the rules of the world in this script change a lot, and I think this film would have been a lot better if the animals didn\\'t talk - and also if the robot hadn\\'t been searching for \"love\" because all it did was raise a baby duck that probably took all of a few weeks.\\n\\nAnyhow, this is a good kids movie, not a great one, but it has spectacular animation and that carries it in the end.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"DreamWorks managed to bring back the magic of animated cinema with The Wild Robot, a feeling we used to associate with Pixar. For years, Pixar films were all about heart and originality, but over the last 14 years, I feel most of their movies, except for Inside Out (2015), have become more generic and superficial. Thankfully, The Wild Robot, even though from a different studio, brought me that same nostalgic feeling I get from watching Pixar's older films.\\n\\nThe story of The Wild Robot is simple yet beautiful and moving. It explores the contrast between technology and nature in a way that's both touching and thought-provoking. From the beginning, we're drawn in by the innocence of the main robot and the curiosity of the animals around it, showing us a unique example of how the natural and artificial can coexist. This contrast is handled with great care, and for most of the movie, I felt fully immersed in the beauty of this interaction.\\n\\nThe characters, each with their own distinct personalities, are instantly captivating. Every scene has this nostalgic touch that takes you back to the magic of classic animated films, the kind I watched as a kid that seemed endlessly enchanting. It's a film that can truly appeal to both kids and adults.\\n\\nHowever, while the first two acts are genuinely emotional and avoid clichés by leaving out forced villains or action scenes, the final act takes a more conventional turn, which is a bit disappointing. It seems to lose some of its original essence and the potential for a unique message, and the ending feels unnecessarily bittersweet, almost as if the producers were already considering a sequel. This final act could have been better developed or even left out entirely to preserve the story's integrity. Personally, I think it would have worked just fine without a traditional villain, focusing instead on a pure journey of discovery.\\n\\nDespite this change in the ending, The Wild Robot is a fantastic title, a breath of fresh air for the genre, and so far, the best animation this year. It's a film with valuable lessons that can charm and move us, leaving a positive impact on everyone. I highly recommend it for the whole family, reminding us that animation can still touch the hearts of adults, just as it did when we were kids.\",\n",

I was so excited after reading all of these opinions, I prepared myself and bought chips and beer. Well, shortly after 30 minutes I realized the movie goes to nowhere.\\n\\nIt\\'s another movie about teamwork, respect, tolerance - I\\'ve watched dozens of them in my entire life and here I got nothing new.\\n\\nThe movie begins super slowly and doesn\\'t build up anything quite deeper besides one actually cool thing - realistic nature where animals eat each other. The movie is not long so I feel they wasted lots of time on telling/showing us how the robot is designed to serve people. At some point the robots adopts a bird and with help of the fox, they\\'re trying to raise the bird, which is sometimes rushed. The moment when the bird needs to migrate like the rest of his kind, I didn\\'t feel anything because the movie didn\\'t build up any emotional connection. The story here is super cliche and flat. Well, [It\\'s another movie about teamwork, respect, tolerance - I\\'ve watched dozens of them in my entire life and here I got nothing new], an average comedy movie made 15 years ago delivers the same message, which makes EVERYTHING predictable.\\n\\nThere are some major problems I dislike such as: \\n* Why didn\\'t the company send another aircraft after the failed one? They waited for another signal despite the story shows us how important the robot was for them. The robot had time to spend more time with the nature therefore you can see how the time pasts.\\n\\n\\n\\n* Maybe I missed it, but I thought the central part (the core) is the most important part of the robot to be \"alive\". Minor spoiler! The robots throws it away to save its bird and then everything it\\'s alright for a long time.\\n\\n\\n\\n* I hate it, I HATE IT, how the story ESTABLISHED the nature is realistic but at some point they say: You know, you can change. No, the animals can\\'t stop eating each other. Dreamworks showed the animals are realistic here and it\\'s a part of this story that they need to adapt, obey to the nature. It\\'s not The Lion King where that part is ignored. You can\\'t say it is analogy to a real life issues while the thing is a basic need of the characters. Some people might compare it to anger, toxic responses etc. But we as humans can live without these, so that is BIG MINUS.\\n\\n\\nThe movie is alright, watch it with your kids.

Tolkien, in an attempt to understand the work's phenomenal success and influence. The program looks for answers in the author's sources of inspiration, from the folk legends of Norway to the field of linguistics of which Tolkien was a lifelong student. It finds that the deep chord the story strikes owes its resonance to the author's use of archetypal imagery and language. Many examples of these recurrent themes and images are given, with readings from the work and other literature. Interviews with the book's illustrators, the brothers Hildebrandt, speak to the power of the imagery in the classic story. Scholars, Tolkien's children, and the author himself provide insight into the mythic themes and the spell they have cast over the vast readership of The Lord of the Rings.\",\n",

So there were many films like this one, but not all of them are received well. It was a decent flick, if you consider from the real world aspect, but definitely a very nice entertainer. Very tense plot, especially in the second half till the final scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a minimal cast film and the entire story takes place in an Internation Space Station in the Earth orbit with a lab facility. They've come from Mars with a soil sample to study for any sign of life. Their historic discovery does not become a happy event as they encounter life threatening trouble on-board. The remaining is to focus their rest of the mission that how it'll end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the second film with the same name I've seen in the recent time. The other one was a biographical-drama starring Robert Pattison, but this is an sci-fi-thriller. Lots of big names in it, but the film did not make that kind of a big buzz. It was considered a good fictional space film. Kind of inspired by other similar themed flicks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLots of thrills, fast paced narration, a simple story with the nice visuals. From the Swedish director of 'Easy Money' fame. There were lots of speculations about its connection with other films. But nothing was confirmed by the filmmakers. I hope there will be a sequel, but this time it won't be same as the story might take place in a different setting.

As with all bad horror movies, the horror only exists because of people ignoring even the simplest rules or just not talking to each other. Add various logic errors to it and you have _\\\"Life\\\"_.\\r\\n\\r\\n**⚠ SPOILERS AHEAD ⚠**\\r\\n\\r\\nThings turn stupid when they start to experiment with that unknown life-form in a lab not suited for that at all. And they don't use remote controlled robot-arms but simple rubber gloves. The life-form, of course, instinctively knows how to use tools and how to penetrate rubber.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt then flees through a CO₂ nozzle (after an empty! flamethrower still had its pilot flame on and triggered the fire alarm) and doesn't end up in some tank but no, somehow gets into the rest of the space station. And this was only possible, because the computer to close the nozzles is a 1950s pocket calculator and you have to close them one by one by entering a 20-digit ID for each one or so it seems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is driven by people knowingly opening hatches that should've been kept closed. Or not talking to each other, like telling the others that the creature is currently nibbling at one's leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother highlight is the creature, finally trapped outside the station, finding its way back in THROUGH THE EFFING THRUSTERS. Why they seem to be connected to the inside of the space station is beyond me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSame applies to 2 guys venting all air from a (sealed) module, but a 3rd guy opening the hatch from a pressurised area to said module without any indication the module was without pressure. (And, of course, he didn't know anything about the creature being trapped there, because he threw away his comm device the moment it had a bit of reception issues earlier.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole movie is so wrong, I almost had to laugh. Especially, when the last survivors escape in 2 separate escape pods and the one which should reach Earth gets hit by debris and flies into outer space and the other one, *trying* to get away from Earth is kept from doing that by the creature who suddenly seemed to have acquired knowledge about steering NASA issue escape pods and is keeping the human from altering the course.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe torture ends with some Asian fishermen simply opening the hatch of the space capsule that just landed in front of them. Although they can clearly see the astronaut trapped in some spiderweb-like goo inside.

It's always going to be unfair to judge a film of this type by the bar raiser that was Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), but really the familiarity on show here is tantamount to being naughty.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of space explorers discover an alien life form and after the initial wonderment and excitement subsides, things quickly turn bad, with the potential for threat to mankind as we know it...\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's pretty much it, really, the cast go through the motions of being in a play that is basically the characters being picked off by an alien manta ray thingy. Standard formula takes a grip of the viewer, who will be killed? who is next? will anyone survive? and etc. The makers - just to continue the unadventurous theme - throw in a Deep Blue Sea moment, while Hiroyuki Sanada has wandered in off of Sunshine's Icarrus II to feature aboard the International Space Station. The ending has and will infuriate many, but personally I liked it, very much from The Twilight Zone dimension, to which it lifts the piece just above averageville.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot recommended with any conviction, especially to sci-fi fans stung by serious science defects and logic holes, while casual sci-fiers would be better off with the brilliance of Alien or something more fun packed and unpretentious like Leviathan (1989).

       "   'content': '***The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers***\\r\\n\\r\\nRELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it\\'s easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue\\'s witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film\\'s stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90\\'s films and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with \\'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let ’em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film\\'s worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it\\'s a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God’s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn’t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTTOM LINE: If you\\'re in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can\\'t go wrong with \"Pulp Fiction.\" It\\'s top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area.

       "   'content': 'Ving Rhames (\"Wallace\") is the kingpin who provides the loosest of templates for a couple of inter-twining tales that are amusing, bizarre and sometimes down right dangerous before we get a sort of alignment at the conclusion. \"Winnfield\" (Samuel L. Jackson) and \"Vincent Vega\" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of \"Mr. Wolf\" (Harvey Keitel). \"Vega\" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife \"Mia\" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer \"Butch\" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and \"Wallace\" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It\\'s really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between \"Mia\" and \"Vega\" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth) and his pal \"Honey Bunny\" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!',\n",

       "   'content': '**One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino… but I think it\\'s not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino\\'s career and made him one of the \"superstar\" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don\\'t think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn\\'t call it regular, a “safe bet”, but we can\\'t deny it, it\\'s original, true to his style and doesn\\'t seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90\\'s. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It\\'s reasonably good, it\\'s gained cult status, it has fans, but it\\'s not a masterpiece, not for me. It\\'s not a boring film, it doesn\\'t tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There\\'s a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it\\'s something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn\\'t matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the “pulp” literary subgenre. I\\'m not, it\\'s not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn\\'t like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn\\'t… watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible… it\\'s the kind of “literature” that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn\\'t know by heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn\\'t bad, but he\\'s just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I\\'m sorry she couldn\\'t go further, but that\\'s life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn\\'t. He\\'s a ham as an actor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.',\n",

But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.\",\"created_at\":\"2024-10-09T13:27:16.982Z\",\"id\":\"670684b4a88614d6b08af58b\",\"updated_at\":\"2024-10-09T13:27:17.052Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/670684b4a88614d6b08af58b\"},{\"author\":\"good.film\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"good.film\",\"avatar_path\":\"/qNIuoHqjycQwIgwqAeb3bJszAL6.jpg\",\"rating\":null},\"content\":\"Brimming with thoughtful themes and stunning artwork, The Wild Robot is a deeply meaningful new touchstone in animated film.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOf course, animation has “heroed” nature before – see The Lion King, WALL-E and basically the entire output of Studio Ghibli.

Whatever it is that needs doing, it is there to make it happen - even when it is wrecked on an island populated by animals whose main desire in life is to eat each other. At least the arrival of the \\\\\"monster\\\\\" manages to galvanise them into one brief moment of hostile unanimity and so when they are not trying to cannibalise it, they are shunning it\\'s efforts to be friends. After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (\\\\\"Fink\\\\\") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name \\\\\"Brightbill\\\\\". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as \\\\\"Roz\\\\\" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter.

No, of course there\\'s no jeopardy here at all, and at times it\\'s comes across as an amalgam of \\\\\"Wall:E\\\\\" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That\\'s no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it\\'s genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy.

    "reviews = ['One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it\\'s also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn\\'t know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn\\'t be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won\\'t pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I\\'ve ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.\\n\\nThe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it\\'s essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino\\'s originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.\\n\\nPerhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one\\'s going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you\\'d find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren\\'t just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia\\'s statement to Vincent, \"That\\'s when you know you\\'ve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"\\n\\nWhat is the movie\\'s purpose exactly? I\\'m not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn\\'t just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it\\'s a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.\\n\\nThere\\'s a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch\\'s act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we\\'re never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.\\n\\nStill, it\\'s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn\\'t need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.',\n",

    "  \"Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh.\\n\\nAs many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .\\n\\nSo if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead(duh): For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.\\n\\nSorry for the huge review..\",\n",
    "  \"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.\",\n",
    "  'I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we\\'ve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it\\'s a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it\\'s just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there\\'s the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with \\'Pulp Fiction\\'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of \"chapters\" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it\\'s just a pure joy to watch.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even \"stealing\" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino\\'s masterpiece today, it\\'s impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after \\'Pulp Fiction\\'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it\\'s got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it\\'s such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It\\'s – well: it\\'s \\'Pulp Fiction\\'. 10 stars out of 10.\\n\\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\\n\\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\\n\\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/',\n",
    "  \"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.\",\n",
    "  'Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.',\n",
    "  \"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.\",\n",
    "  'Just the best movie... I can imagine my family seeing this movie in 30 years. I really love this movie and his soundtrack.',\n",
    "  'If you think \"Pulp Fiction\" is brilliant, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s more than that. It\\'s a milestone in the history of film making. It\\'s already a classic. But why? Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that\\'s surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don\\'t get it). Tarantino has made a movie that\\'s someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What\\'s so different? He knows the subject of the movie is \"cool\", he knows it\\'s a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren\\'t another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? It\\'s the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it\\'s all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.',\n",
    "  \"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.\\n\\nWhile I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing.\",\n",
    "  'My oh my.  \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino\\'s trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.',\n",
    "  \"I don't understand why this is the 8th highest rated movie of all time. I saw how highly rated it was so decided to watch it. After the first half an hour I found it enjoyable but my mind wasn't blown. As the movie continued I kept waiting for something to happen that warrants its 8.9 stars. Nothing actually happens in this movie. I hope its just me because through my eyes its the most overrated movie of all time.\",\n",
    "  'Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I\\'m not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I\\'m not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I\\'d enjoyed it. I couldn\\'t say for sure though.\\n\\nStill feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I\\'d failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I\\'ve ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I\\'d seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.\\n\\nSince then I\\'ve watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\nOne of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character\\'s actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.\\n\\nThis collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they\\'re all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino\\'s films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren\\'t too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.\\n\\nNow, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what\\'s there to say about these elements of the film that haven\\'t already been said? Tarantino\\'s screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson\\'s best performance, one of Bruce Willis\\' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who\\'s arguably the film\\'s main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace\\'s girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that\\'s another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?\\n\\nAs I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you\\'ve seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film\\'s of the past 20 years, so you\\'ve likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who\\'ve gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.\\n\\nSo instead, I\\'m going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.\\n\\nPulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn\\'t promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn\\'t mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince\\'s carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin\\'s head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules\\' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy\\'s house and consult \"The Wolf\" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus\\' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck\\'s store when they are taken captive.\\n\\nBut in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino\\'s other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we\\'ve seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it\\'s damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules\\' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.\\n\\nNot a shot is fired. No one is killed. It\\'s an absolutely beautiful scene.\\n\\nIt may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a \"Wild Bunch-esque\" ending, but instead he refrained, and I\\'m glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that\\'s why it\\'s my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it. And if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again.',\n",
    "  \"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film.\",\n",
    "  \"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.\",\n",
    "  \"This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments\",\n",
    "  \"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?\",\n",
    "  \"One of the best movies I have ever seen is a fun and enjoyable story, as most of the film's characters were excellent, and it brought back the character of Butch and his girlfriend, Vincent was the best character and his death was shocking and I did not. Expect that, the interconnectedness of the film's stories was excellent, the direction in the film was excellent The film, the acting in the movie was very cool, I recommend it, and it is the best film by Quentin Tarantino\",\n",
    "  \"I heard so many people claim that this movie is a masterpiece and it also has high ratings. So I was intrigued to give it a go. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe you have to watch it multiple times to enjoy it. As for the first viewing it didn't satisfy me.\",\n",
    "  'Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90\\'s. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez\\'s was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70\\'s. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.\\n\\nIt was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I\\'m not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino\\'s or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.\\n\\nAnyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that\\'s really a contradiction because one of the movie\\'s finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I\\'m concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a \"tough guy\" image at the beginning and then we discover he\\'s so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it\\'s highest point.\\n\\nThe other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. \"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...\" is my favourite quote.\\n\\nSummarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.',\n",

The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind.

The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it\\'s pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That\\'s not to say that it isn\\'t good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.',\n",
    "  \"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium .\"]\n",

The infamous \\'epic\\' scene with Butch is more cringeworthy than redeeming, and the constant references to sex and violence start to feel like a desperate attempt to be provocative.

    "and redemption.', 'reviews': ['One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it\\'s also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn\\'t know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn\\'t be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won\\'t pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" \n",
    "It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I\\'ve ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.\\n\\nThe movie becomes \n",
    "a bit easier to understand once you realize that it\\'s essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino\\'s originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.\\n\\nPerhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one\\'s going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you\\'d find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren\\'t just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia\\'s statement to Vincent, \"That\\'s when you know you\\'ve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for \n",
    "a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"\\n\\nWhat is the movie\\'s purpose exactly? I\\'m not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to \n",
    "be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn\\'t just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it\\'s a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.\\n\\nThere\\'s a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch\\'s act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we\\'re never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.\\n\\nStill, it\\'s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn\\'t need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.', 'I like the bit with the cheeseburger.

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.\", 'Just the best movie...

The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.

I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\nOne of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies.

    "makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they\\'re all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique.

    "dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren\\'t too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a \n",
    "half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.\\n\\nNow, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what\\'s there to say about these elements of the film that haven\\'t already been said? Tarantino\\'s screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson\\'s best performance, one of Bruce Willis\\' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who\\'s arguably the film\\'s main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace\\'s girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that\\'s another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?\\n\\nAs I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you\\'ve seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film\\'s of the past 20 years, so you\\'ve likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who\\'ve gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.\\n\\nSo instead, I\\'m going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.\\n\\nPulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn\\'t promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn\\'t mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince\\'s carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes \n",

Marsellus\\' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck\\'s store when they are taken captive.\\n\\nBut in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino\\'s other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we\\'ve seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too.

Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.\\n\\nNot a shot is fired. No one is killed.

Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close).

We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage.

But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .\\n\\nSo if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead(duh): For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch \n",
    "about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but \n",
    "the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.\\n\\nSorry for the huge review..\", \"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. \n",
    "It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this \n",
    "movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene \n",
    "has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, \n",
    "every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.\", 'I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we\\'ve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it\\'s a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it\\'s just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there\\'s the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with \\'Pulp Fiction\\'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of \"chapters\" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it\\'s just a pure joy to watch.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even \"stealing\" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino\\'s masterpiece today, it\\'s impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films \n",
    "- never looked quite the same after \\'Pulp Fiction\\'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it\\'s got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it\\'s such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It\\'s – well: it\\'s \\'Pulp Fiction\\'. 10 stars out of 10.\\n\\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\\n\\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\\n\\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/', \"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since \n",
    "it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.\", 'Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.', \"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. \n",
    "Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.\", 'Just the best movie... I can imagine my family seeing this movie in 30 years. I really love this movie and his soundtrack.', 'If you think \"Pulp Fiction\" is brilliant, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s more than that. It\\'s a milestone in the history of film making. It\\'s already a classic. But why? Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that\\'s surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don\\'t get it). Tarantino has made a movie that\\'s someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What\\'s so different? He knows the subject of the movie is \"cool\", he \n",
    "knows it\\'s a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren\\'t another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? It\\'s the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it\\'s all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.', \"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The \n",
    "entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.\\n\\nWhile I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing.\", 'My oh my.  \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino\\'s trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented \n",
    "his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.', 'Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I\\'m not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I\\'m not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated \n",
    "and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I\\'d enjoyed it. I couldn\\'t say for sure though.\\n\\nStill feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I\\'d failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I\\'ve ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I\\'d seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.\\n\\nSince then I\\'ve watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.\\n\\nSpoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\nOne of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character\\'s actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.\\n\\nThis collage of various movie genres \n",
    "is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they\\'re all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino\\'s films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren\\'t too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he \n",
    "simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.\\n\\nNow, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what\\'s there to say about these elements of the film that haven\\'t \n",
    "already been said? Tarantino\\'s screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson\\'s best performance, one of Bruce Willis\\' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who\\'s arguably the film\\'s main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace\\'s girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that\\'s another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?\\n\\nAs I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you\\'ve seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film\\'s of the past 20 years, so you\\'ve likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who\\'ve gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.\\n\\nSo instead, I\\'m going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.\\n\\nPulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn\\'t promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn\\'t mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince\\'s carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin\\'s head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules\\' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy\\'s house and consult \"The Wolf\" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus\\' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck\\'s store when they are taken captive.\\n\\nBut in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino\\'s other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we\\'ve seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin \n",
    "and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it\\'s damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine \n",
    "every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules\\' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.\\n\\nNot a shot is fired. No one is killed. It\\'s an absolutely beautiful scene.\\n\\nIt may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a \"Wild Bunch-esque\" ending, but instead he refrained, and I\\'m glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely \n",
    "stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to \n",
    "notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that\\'s why it\\'s my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it. And if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again.', \"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus \n",

Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.'], 'negative_reviews': ['One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it\\'s also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn\\'t know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn\\'t be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won\\'t pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique \n",
    "and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed \n",

    "bit easier to understand once you realize that it\\'s essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino\\'s originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.\\n\\nPerhaps no screenplay has \n",
    "ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one\\'s going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you\\'d find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren\\'t just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia\\'s statement to Vincent, \"That\\'s when you know you\\'ve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a \n",

    "is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one \n",
    "of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn\\'t just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of \n",
    "equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it\\'s a patter that establishes their \n",
    "separateness from the non-criminal world.\\n\\nThere\\'s a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch\\'s act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we\\'re never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.\\n\\nStill, it\\'s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both.

It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop.

I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list\\x85 don't waste your time!\", \"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs \n",
    "to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. \n",
    "The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot \n",
    "Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great \n",
    "because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium .\"], 'positive_review_summary': \"Pulp Fiction is a cinematic \n",
    "masterpiece that redefines the boundaries of storytelling. Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus is a work of genius, weaving together a complex tapestry of interconnected narratives that are both captivating and thought-provoking. The film's direction is bold and innovative, with a unique non-linear structure that adds to the overall sense of tension and intrigue. The performances are outstanding, with a talented ensemble cast delivering memorable and iconic characters that have become ingrained in popular culture. The film's cool and stylish tone is infectious, making it a must-see for anyone who loves great cinema. With its high ratings and widespread critical acclaim, Pulp Fiction is a movie that truly lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.\", 'negative_review_summary': \"The characters in Pulp Fiction are overly eccentric and lack any real depth. The non-linear storytelling and disjointed dialogue make the film feel chaotic and hard to follow. Despite its lengthy runtime, the movie fails to deliver any meaningful moments, instead relying on gratuitous violence and sex to shock the audience. The film's portrayal of violence is particularly disturbing, glorifying the actions of despicable characters and making light of their brutal behavior. The sex scenes, while sparse, feel gratuitous and unnecessary, particularly the infamous scene where Butch redeems himself, which comes across as more awkward than epic. The film's attempt to balance randomness with a cause-and-effect narrative falls flat, feeling more like a jumbled mess than a cleverly crafted puzzle. Overall, Pulp Fiction feels like a lesser version of Reservoir Dogs, another Tarantino film that explores similar themes with more finesse and restraint.\"}"
